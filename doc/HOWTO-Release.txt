Red5 release manual
===================

This document describes the steps necessary to create a new release of Red5:

1. Make sure everything has been committed to the trunk or correct branch.

2. Update the file doc/changelog.txt with informations about the new release.

3. Create tags of the modules that are linked into the main code tree:

   - documentation at http://svn1.cvsdude.com/osflash/red5/doc/tags
   
   Tags for versions should always be the version string with dots replaced
   by underscores, e.g. version "1.2.3" becomes tag "1_2_3".
   
   If you would tag the documentation folder for version "1.2.3", you would
   use the url http://svn1.cvsdude.com/osflash/red5/doc/tags/1_2_3

4. Tag the server code according to the naming scheme from above at
   http://svn1.cvsdude.com/osflash/red5/java/server/tags

5. Update the svn:externals in the newly created server code tag to point
   to the tagged modules from step 3.

6. You're done.
