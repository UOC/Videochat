 HOWTO build a Red5 debian package
===================================

1. Install the debian packages "dpkg-dev", "debhelper", "dh-make",
   "devscripts" and "fakeroot".
2. Checkout the debian build scripts to a folder "debian" inside the Red5
   root from http://svn1.cvsdude.com/osflash/red5/debian/trunk
3. Update "debian/changelog" and add an entry for the new version you are
   building. Note that the syntax must match the previous entries!
4. Update the filename in "debian/files" to match the version you are
   building.
5. Make sure you run from a clean Red5 checkout of the tag to build!!!
6. From the red5 root run "dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b -rfakeroot"
7. If all goes well, you should have a debian package one folder below the
   Red5 root.
