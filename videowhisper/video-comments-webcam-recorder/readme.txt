The Video Comments Webcam Recorder allows WordPress users to record video comments as responses to posts or to other comments. A supported rtmp host is required.
Supports playback with JwPlayer plugin and HTML5 playback if conversion is supported by host.

== Description ==
The Video Comments Webcam Recorder allows WordPress users to record video comments as responses to posts or to other comments. If the user is not logged into WordPress he cannot access this feature.
Supports playback with JwPlayer plugin.

More details about this, including solutions are provided on the Installation section pages.

== Desktop Sharing / Screen Broadcasting ==
If your users want to broadcast their screen (when playing a game, using a program, tutoring various computer skills) they can do that easily just by using a screen sharing driver that simulates a webcam from desktop contents.
